/*
 * proxy.c — Prototype d3d9 proxy.
 *
 * Ported 2026-09-14 from dead-space-2-vr's proxy, which was built and debugged the
 * same day. It arrives here already carrying that day's two expensive lessons, so
 * Prototype does not have to pay for either of them:
 *
 *   ⭐ 1. EXPORT ALL SEVENTEEN, not just Direct3DCreate9. A proxy exporting one
 *         function stopped Dead Space 2 launching outright — the game called
 *         D3DPERF_GetStatus six seconds into start-up, the lookup resolved to
 *         NULL against our DLL, and calling NULL gave a DEP kill at fault offset
 *         0x00000000 with no owning module. `[verified-live 2026-09-14]` It took
 *         an A/B against a genuine Microsoft d3d9.dll to prove it was our DLL and
 *         not the game's DRM. The sixteen we do not implement are forwarded by
 *         naked thunks in thunks.c, each of which logs its first call.
 *
 *   ⭐ 2. WRAP IDirect3D9, DO NOT PATCH ITS VTABLE. Patching slot 16 stood down on
 *         every launch because something (almost certainly the Steam overlay) was
 *         already there — and standing down happens before a device exists, so the
 *         camera instrument could never install. See wrap_d3d9.c.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEITHER lesson has been re-verified on Prototype. They are carried because the
 * mechanism is generic (any Steam D3D9 game can have an overlay hook; any game can
 * call any d3d9 export), not because this game has been observed needing them.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE. Prototype's exe is a 2.5 MB stub; the engine — and the
 * d3d9 import — live in `prototypeenginef.dll`. That does not change the injection
 * point: DLL search order is a property of the PROCESS, so a d3d9.dll beside
 * prototypef.exe is still found first.
 *
 * ⭐ AND WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. Prototype ships readable HLSL source in
 * `shaders.rcf`, which declares:
 *
 *       const float4x4 p3dWorldViewProjectionMatrix: register( c0 );
 *       p3dPositionWorldViewProjection = mul( world_view_proj_matrix, position );
 *
 * So this game uses a FUSED world-view-projection matrix, unlike Dead Space 2's
 * separate projection. The instrument below is register-agnostic and will confirm
 * or refute that independently — which is the point of running it rather than
 * trusting the sample.
 *
 * REVERSIBILITY: delete the d3d9.dll next to prototypef.exe. Nothing else is
 * touched — no game file is modified, no registry key is written.
 *
 * Built 32-bit: prototypef.exe and prototypeenginef.dll are both PE32/i386.
