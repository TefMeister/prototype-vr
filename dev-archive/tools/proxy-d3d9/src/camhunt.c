/*
 * camhunt.c — find Prototype's projection matrix. READ-ONLY.
 *
 * Ported 2026-09-14 from dead-space-2-vr, which ported it the same day from
 * staging/alan-wake-vr/proxy-d3d9/src/proxy.c, where it reached this shape the
 * expensive way over four sessions. The three lessons
 * that cost the most there are carried over deliberately, and each is marked
 * ⭐ below so they are not "simplified away" by a later reader who has not paid
 * for them:
 *
 *   ⭐ 1. REGISTER-AGNOSTIC. The first Alan Wake instrument watched four
 *         candidate registers taken from a shader census, and the projection
 *         turned out not to be at any of them. Every 4-register window of every
 *         upload is tested here instead. We do not know Dead Space 2's register
 *         and must not pretend to.
 *
 *   ⭐ 2. KEYED BY THE PROJECTION, NOT BY THE REGISTER. Keying the
 *         "already logged this" table by register meant a shadow pass uploading
 *         a projection at c0 permanently MASKED the camera projection at c0 —
 *         hiding the one matrix the session most needed. The key here is
 *         (xs, ys), the two diagonal scale terms: they differ between a shadow
 *         frustum and the camera, and they are unchanged by transpose, so the
 *         key does not depend on settling the storage layout first.
 *
 *   ⭐ 3. A SATURATED TABLE MUST SAY SO. The distinct-signature table filled
 *         during a load-time FOV settle, and every later signature — including
 *         the settled gameplay FOV, the one value actually wanted — was dropped
 *         silently. So the drop count is printed, and a separate LIVE table
 *         reports what is happening *now* rather than what was seen first.
 *
 * BOTH PACKINGS ARE TESTED. A 4x4 can reach the GPU as four rows or four
 * columns. Testing only one packing is how the Alan Wake scan found nothing in
 * its first run. `layout R` puts the w-from-z term at index 11; `layout C` puts
 * it at index 14.
 *
 * COST. This runs on a function called thousands of times per frame, so the hot
 * path does no I/O and no formatting — only comparisons, and logging behind a
 * time gate.

 * A D3D perspective projection has a recognisable shape whichever way it is
 * packed: the w output is +-1 times view z, the w row/column is otherwise zero,
 * and the homogeneous corner is zero. We also require the z term to be non-zero,
 * which rejects an identity-like block that would otherwise pass.
 *
 * Tolerances are deliberately loose on the +-1 (0.9..1.1) and tight on the zeros:
 * a real projection's zeros are exact, while the +-1 can carry a reversed-Z or
 * infinite-far tweak.

    /* ---- the diagonal gate, added 2026-09-14 after a FALSE POSITIVE in play.
     * A Dead Space 2 gameplay log matched a block at c18 that is plainly not a
     * projection:
     *     [ 0.005  0      -0.05   200 ]
     *     [ 0      0     128        0 ]
     *     [ 1      1       1        1 ]
     *     [ 0      0       1        0 ]
     * It passed the column-layout test because the w terms happened to line up.
     * What gives it away is the diagonal: ys is ZERO, and a projection with a
     * zero vertical scale would collapse the image to a line -- it cannot exist.
     * Requiring both scale terms to be non-zero and within a sane range rejects
     * it, and rejects the whole family of UI/HUD constant blocks it belongs to,
     * without touching any real projection.
     *
     * ⚠️ The floor was 0.005f for about five minutes and the self-test rejected
     * it: xs is cot(fovY/2) divided AGAIN by the aspect ratio, so a 179-degree
     * field at 16:9 gives xs = 0.0049 and would have been thrown away. The
     * comment here originally said "even a 179-degree field gives ~0.009",
     * which was the ys figure and forgot the aspect divide. 0.001f leaves room
     * for a field nobody would ever use while still rejecting the exact zero
     * that the c18 block has. */
